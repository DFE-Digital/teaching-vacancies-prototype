<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get back into teaching</h2>
<p>Returning to teaching might be easier than you think.</p>

<p>Time away and different life experiences can help give you a fresh perspective on being a teacher.</p>

<p>Schools are interested in recruiting former teachers like you so you can continue your teaching career with them.</p>

<p>A return to teaching provides you with an opportunity to take greater control of your career to shape a role that suits your skills, ambition and situation.</p>

<p>Flexible working options can also help you start back in a way that works for you.</p>

<p>Billy Bone, Return to Teaching Adviser&nbsp;</p>



<p>My role as a Return to Teaching Adviser is to offer one-to-one personal support for teachers who are looking to return to the classroom in certain subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m effectively a mentor to the candidates that I support. I offer impartial advice on gaining classroom experience, keeping up to date with the&nbsp;national curriculum and also keeping up to speed with educational developments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can also offer you support with searching for job vacancies, writing your personal statement and completing your application form, preparing for your teaching interview and securing that all-important role.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What experience do Return to Teaching Advisers have?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As a secondary school teacher for 10 years, I really enjoyed helping children with their learning and giving them confidence for the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has now transferred to my career as an adviser and I now look to help returning teachers get back into the classroom so they can start inspiring children again. As a team we have experience teaching a wide range of subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also taught in a variety of school settings. This means that we&#8217;re able to offer you bespoke support depending on your experience and your needs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top tips for returning to teaching</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s really important to focus on gaining classroom experience and also getting up to speed with the national curriculum, along with educational developments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need knowledge of the teaching standards and how you can document this information. It&#8217;s important that you can showcase your qualities as a teacher and also demonstrate any transferable skills that you&#8217;ve developed that could be utilised within the classroom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you might be thinking that you don&#8217;t have the confidence to return to teaching, but I&#8217;m here to tell you that you definitely can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you gain some valuable classroom experience and you get back into the swing of things, you&#8217;ll realise that this is something you can really do and there&#8217;s nothing better for me as a Return to Teaching Adviser when you secure a role.&nbsp;</p>
