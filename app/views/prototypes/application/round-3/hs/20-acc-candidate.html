                        <p class="govuk-body"> 
                            I am a passionate, confident ITT trainee who aims to inspire and nurture the students at Bronson Alcott Academy as a newly qualified teacher. As someone who grew up in Newham and is local to the school, I understand the school and the community it serves. The school’s ethos and commitment to celebrating diversity is important to me and is something I embed in everything I do, including teaching.
                        </p>
                        <p class="govuk-body"> 
                            I first became interested in primary teaching through volunteering with the charity Literacy Pirates, which runs a reading and writing after-school programme for children at risk of falling behind in literacy. It is through this experience and talking to the session leaders who were all former primary school teachers that I realised I enjoyed working with this age range. I further explored what a career in teaching might be like through getting schools experience at my local primary school and speaking to primary school teachers. Completing my Initial Teacher Training at the Institute of Education at UCL has furthered my passion for teaching and prepared me to effectively teach and be accountable for a class of students.
                        </p>
                        <p class="govuk-body"> 
                            Throughout my Initial Teacher Training, I am confident covering all National Curriculum subjects. I have completed a placement in Key Stage (Years 1-2) and I am currently on placement in Key Stage 2 (Years 5 and 6). I prefer the latter education phase, and this is also the age group I worked with at Literacy Pirates. Both placements have been at inner-city schools in Hackney and Newham, where the classes are incredibly diverse and thus make for an enriching, interesting teaching experience.
                        </p>
                        <p class="govuk-body"> 
                            I value diversity and strive to promote it in everything I do, especially in teaching. My time in school has developed my philosophy of valuing each child as an individual, with ideas and potential, as well as part of a community. I attended the Masterclass on Diversity in Schools which encouraged me to put diversity and inclusion at the heart of my teaching. I strive to ensure that all children, regardless of ability, learning needs, language, ethnic origin, disabilities or any other factor are engaged and included in lessons. I have learnt how to identify and find ways to effectively aid the learning and meet their needs in ways which appeal to and best help them develop, gain a beneficial experience from their education and achieve their full potential. I have incorporated some of my learning in my final practice, as there was an autistic child in the class. I ensured that his learning needs were planned for and his TA was fully aware of what was expected.
                        </p>
                        <p class="govuk-body"> 
                            Through my placements in school, I believe that sharing learning objectives and success criteria with children is one of the most effective ways to get the best out of them. Knowing exactly what is expected and how they can achieve allows children to focus more clearly on tasks. This also facilitates effective self and peer assessments, as there are clear criteria and objectives to assess against, encouraging children to take more responsibility for their own learning.
                        </p>
                        <p class="govuk-body"> 
                            My approach is to give children as many learning opportunities and experiences as possible in order to engage, motivate and prepare them for future life in a diverse city, and indeed, world. An appropriate, balanced, challenging and creative curriculum is essential in developing children’s skills, knowledge and understanding. These all underpin personalised learning. As a teacher, I​ ​feel I can best meet children’s learning needs if I am aware of the learning style suited to them. When I prepare lessons, I make a conscious effort to ensure I am not just catering for visual learners like myself, but try to ensure I am thinking about learners.
                        </p>
                        <p class="govuk-body"> 
                            Ultimately, I always strive to make learning interesting and creative. Sometimes I use drama to engage children and enable them to explore and understand situations, and express their views and feelings. For example, I hosted a debate with Year 5 when they were learning about migration to the West of the USA, around reasons for and against going and people affected. The students put themselves in the shoes of different people and families who were making the decision to go, as well as the people affected, in this case, native americans. Alongside enjoying the task and having fun with it, they not only gained knowledge, but developed empathy for those involved.
                        </p> 
                        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-0"> 
                            Completing my Initial Teacher Training, particularly my school placements, has confirmed my belief that teaching is one of the most challenging, demanding, exhausting but varied and exciting careers there are. I really look forward to working in a job that is so important, being privileged to be such a vital part of so many young lives and making a real difference at Bronson Alcott Academy.
