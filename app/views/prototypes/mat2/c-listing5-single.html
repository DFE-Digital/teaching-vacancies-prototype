                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        Bronson Alcott Academy is a co-educational comprehensive school based in South Yorkshire for students aged 11-16. It is a non-denominational school.
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        The heart of the school building, a solid stone quadrangle enclosing an impressive dome which houses the library, dates back to 1912 whilst the rest of the school is modern and purpose built, much of it within the last 15 years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        Class sizes are deliberately kept small at the school. Outside the classroom, the school also organises many trips ranging from day trips to art galleries or museums in London, to overseas visits. 
                    </p>
