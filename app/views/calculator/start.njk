            A pay award was announced for school teachers and leaders on 30 June 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you’re a school teacher or leader, use this calculator to see: 
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>an estimate of your new salary </li>
            <li>how much your salary could increase by </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The pay award takes effect from 1 September 2023. If you start receiving your new salary after this date, your salary will be backdated.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The pay award may not apply if you work in further education or for an academy that does not follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-teachers-pay-and-conditions">school teachers’ pay and conditions document (link opens in new tab)</a>.  
        </p>

            This calculator provides an indication only, pending the outcome of the current statutory consultation process. Schools have flexibility on how they implement the pay award.
