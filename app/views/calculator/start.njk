        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>new salary</li>
            <li>salary increase</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pay award takes effect from 1 September 2023.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            This calculator is indicative only. It's based on a provisional pay framework which is subject to a statutory consultation period. Schools also have flexibility on how they implement the pay award.
        </div>
        <p>The pay framework does not apply in further education or early years. Academies may choose to follow the pay framework.</p>
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
        <p>You'll need to know your current pay point on the teacher pay scale â€“ for example Main Pay Range 1 (M1) or Upper Pay 2 (U2).</p>
