            A pay award was announced for school teachers on 30 June 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you’re a school teacher, use this calculator to see: 
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>an estimate of your new salary </li>
            <li>how much your salary could increase by </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The pay award takes effect from 1 September 2023. If you start receiving your new salary after this date, your salary will be backdated.  
        </p>

            This calculator provides an indication only, using the Teacher's Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) to estimate your new salary. Schools have flexibility on how they implement the pay award.
